# batteryalarm

This code is for our old laptops running windows and we need a battery alarm at lets say X%. I wrote this code because, I needed to charge
my laptop before it hit 60%. So feel free to update, this code and do whatever you want with it.

The following are needed to make it work

Pyaudio
WMI 
Wave

These are easily downloadable at python.org and the documentations are available online.

Have a good day and get remembered to get a warning at 60%
